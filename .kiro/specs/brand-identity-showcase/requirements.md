# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating a React-based brand identity showcase application to the existing Next.js project. The showcase allows users to test their understanding of a company's brand identity through an interactive survey, rate clarity, and generate modified brand images using AI. The migration will replace the Hugging Face image generation with the existing Gemini integration and adapt the UI components to work within the Next.js framework.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view a brand identity showcase image and participate in an interactive survey to test my understanding of what the company offers, so that I can provide feedback on brand clarity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user loads the brand identity showcase page THEN the system SHALL display a professional brand showcase image
2. WHEN the user views the showcase THEN the system SHALL present multiple choice options for what they think the company offers
3. WHEN the user selects "Something else" THEN the system SHALL provide a text input for custom answers
4. WHEN the user submits their answer THEN the system SHALL reveal the correct answer and show their selected answer
5. WHEN the correct answer is revealed THEN the system SHALL display a star rating component for clarity assessment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to rate how clear the brand identity showcase is using a 5-star rating system, so that I can provide feedback on the effectiveness of the brand communication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user hovers over stars THEN the system SHALL highlight stars up to the hovered position and display descriptive labels
2. WHEN the user clicks on a star THEN the system SHALL set the rating to that star value
3. WHEN a rating is selected THEN the system SHALL display the corresponding clarity label ("Not at all clear" to "Very clear")
4. WHEN the user completes the rating THEN the system SHALL unlock the image generation feature

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to generate modified versions of the brand showcase image using AI prompts, so that I can explore different visual approaches to brand communication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user has completed the survey and rating THEN the system SHALL display an image generation form
2. WHEN the user enters a modification prompt THEN the system SHALL use the existing Gemini API to generate a new image
3. WHEN image generation starts THEN the system SHALL display generation logs with timestamped progress updates
4. WHEN image generation completes THEN the system SHALL replace the showcase image with the generated result
5. IF image generation fails THEN the system SHALL display error messages in the log and load a fallback demo image

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view and add comments to a community feedback section, so that I can see what others think about the brand showcase and share my own thoughts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user has not completed the survey THEN the system SHALL show a message to finish the survey to see community feedback
2. WHEN the user completes the survey THEN the system SHALL display existing community comments with names and timestamps
3. WHEN the user clicks "Add Your Comment" THEN the system SHALL show a form with name and comment text fields
4. WHEN the user submits a comment THEN the system SHALL add it to the top of the comments list and save to localStorage
5. WHEN the user cancels comment creation THEN the system SHALL hide the form without saving

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the brand identity showcase to be integrated into the existing Next.js project structure, so that it maintains consistency with the current codebase and uses existing UI components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating the showcase THEN the system SHALL use the existing Next.js app router structure
2. WHEN implementing UI components THEN the system SHALL reuse existing shadcn/ui components from the project
3. WHEN handling image generation THEN the system SHALL use the existing Gemini API routes instead of Hugging Face
4. WHEN styling components THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency with the existing project's design system
5. WHEN managing state THEN the system SHALL use React hooks and follow Next.js best practices

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to track my progress through the survey, so that I can see how much I've completed and what steps remain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user interacts with survey elements THEN the system SHALL calculate completion progress
2. WHEN progress changes THEN the system SHALL update a visual progress indicator
3. WHEN the survey is incomplete THEN the system SHALL disable certain features like community feedback
4. WHEN the survey is complete THEN the system SHALL enable all features and show completion status
5. WHEN the user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL maintain their progress state through localStorage
